        <p>
          With a background in Civil Engineering and a passion for
          problem-solving, I am excited to transition into a career in Software
          Engineering. I have a strong track record of leading the design of
          high-profile projects and excel in client- facing roles, where I
          consistently apply critical and holistic thinking under pressure. I
          recently completed a 3-month Immersive Software Engineering course
          with General Assembly and am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in
          a creative role at a company where I can make a meaningful
          contribution. I have a wealth of experience in improving business
          efficiency through the review and implementation of Civil Engineering
          software practices, and am eager to develop this further within a new
          field of work. I am seeking a role in which I have the support of a
          mentor to develop my existing skill set and learn new relevant
          technical skills for the industry.
