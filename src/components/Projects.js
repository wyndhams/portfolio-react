            Festi is a full-stack application designed to help users search for
            new music festivals for summer months. This is the first project
            using Django as a backend framework for api routing and used
            PostGreSQL to create the database of festivals. I developed a React
            frontend application with Material UI for styling.

            Full Stacked is a fitness web application that allows users to
            navigate a database of workouts, view information about them and
            select exercises to be recorded in a workout log. My role in the
            team was to develop the backend API and all routing in the frontend
            to display data from the database. I was also actively involved in
            bug fixing for the other members of my team.

            This project was developed using Napsterâ€™s public API to select a
            specific year on the home page and to have a random song from that
            year displayed on a separate page. My role in this project was to
            work with the external API to display a random song from the given
            year.

            I developed my own version of the classic game Space Invaders using
            strictly vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had a lot of fun
            implementing logic in this project to increase difficulty through
            levels of the game.
